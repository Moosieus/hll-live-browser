# Planning
I planned this project to learn me some Elixir for great good. Specifically I chose an application that'd require me to learn the ins-and-outs of OTP.

I sketched this excalidraw scene at the outset to ensure I was taking full advantage of OTP's capabilities, and not constraining myself in a synchronous purview.
